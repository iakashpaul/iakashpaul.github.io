  * I graduated from V.V.P. Engineering College, Rajkot

  * I started an eBay shop for 3D printed parts & sold several RPi cases, along with Tindie I'll sell some Drones, Home Automation products & other usefull stuff


Tip for those reading
------
* Print PLA on the acrylic build-plate after applying a coat of water soluble glue (Fevicol & the like) & remove them ~~easily with a nice finish by freezing the build plate~~ nope the print itself contracted & layers got dis-joint. Try to avoid completely flat surfaces by either inserting clever spaces or re-orienting the STL before creating X3Gs.
