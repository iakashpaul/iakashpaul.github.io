Updates

  * I graduated from V.V.P. Engineering College, Rajkot
  * I've joined the startup incubation program at CIIE, IIMA thanks to GTU's Specialization Program
  * I also completed projects utilizing WebRTC, Peer.js, Node.js & Socket.IO.
  * I started an eBay shop for 3D printed parts & sold several RPi cases, along with Tindie I'll sell some Drones, Home Automation products & other usefull stuff


Tip for those reading
------
* Print PLA on the acrylic build-plate after applying a thin coat of PVA glue(Fevicol & the like) diluted with water & remove them ~~easily with a nice finish by freezing the build plate~~ nope the print itself contracted & layers got dis-joint, simply drown the build & later use Razor Scraper from Thingiverse.
* Try to avoid completely flat surfaces by either inserting clever spaces or re-orienting the STL before creating X3Gs.
