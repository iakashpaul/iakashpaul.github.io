title: March all over again!

It's almost time to ring in the 13" MacBook Air(MBA from now on, I promise), I'm almost finished with the WebRTC projects & will hopefully complete the openCV ones over the weekend.
Placement month in fullswing. Pathetic working hours & profiles, all I care about is getting selected through eLitmus or HackerEarth.
Helping everyone out with their projects as much as possible.
