* Received all the parts for the FPV Singlecopter UAV capable of 1kg payloads.

* 2(+1 in tow) more WebRTC projects completed, I finally mastered configuring the iOSRTC plugin for iOS 10. For those stumbling here, just folow [this](https://github.com/eface2face/cordova-plugin-iosrtc/issues/182#issuecomment-249808498). Add the Legacy Swift 2.3 property etc.

* I had an awesome Kerala Trip for an event & climbed a hill at Munnar.

* Also going to put compounding to the test from now on.
