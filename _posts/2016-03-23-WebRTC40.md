So the 7SegmentOCR project has fallen apart due to the contractor being unable to test the first PoC(a little too late from my end too), but nevertheless I have an OCR <!--more--> by using CannyEdge detection & 3 line intersection for recognizing all digits. Building it using SVM and kNN too.

MHJ and I looked up several WebRTC projects on UPWork, so we're dedicating the next 40 days solely to WebRTC apps. We either do  all the projects for them or ourselves. MBA purchase got pushed a few weeks back, banks on strike as well for the week. Lets see how the next 40 days unwrap.
