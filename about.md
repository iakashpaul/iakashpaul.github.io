Hey there! I am Akash Paul. I'm a freelance software developer, who also prototypes a lot of hardware.

I've worked on UAVs, tele-presence solutions & industrial robots. I'm _working_ on creating digital assistants, EVs & droids with AGI. Focussed on inside out VR (cardboardVR with LEAP MOTION or another handheld console for navigating).

I care & _plan_ on eventually making RISC-V ICs(larger nm though), PV-cells, Li-Ion batteries(metal-foils) & LED panels in India.

Inter-planetary travel, dragon-esque flying planes & cliff-diving are things that occupy my mind whenever I go for a run.

cheers!

Akash
