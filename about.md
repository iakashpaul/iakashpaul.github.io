Hey there! I'm an DL engineer & maker (for lack of a better word), finishing up a Qlock Two clock currently.

I've previously built UAVs with cellular control, video-calling apps using WebRTC, worked on a crowdfunded tele-presence solution & built a 3D printed 5 DoF arm during undergrad. I'm also making LLM powered digital assistants & droids(like Chappie/TARS), to help around with various tasks.

- Watch few of the things I make on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@iAkashPaul)

Got a project or idea in mind to work on? Hit me up on Twitter!

Cheers!

Akash
