  BUILD. IMPACT. REPEAT.
</p>

Hey there! I am Akash Paul.

I work on UAVs, tele-presence solutions & industrial robotics. I've also got a keen interest in building digital assistants, electric vehicles, humanoids with AGI & some more stuff. 

I also love working on VR (working on using cardboardVR with LEAP MOTION controller), Node.js, WebRTC, opencv & Android.

Current tinkerware- LEAP MOTION controller,STM32F boards & ESP8266 modules.
