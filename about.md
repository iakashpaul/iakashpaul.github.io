Hey there! I am Akash Paul & I _freelance/consult/mercenarize?_ for software projects & hardware prototypes.

I work on UAVs, tele-presence solutions & industrial robots. I've also got a keen interest in building digital assistants, electric vehicles, droids with AGI & apps on [AppStore]() & [PlayStore]().

I've also started working on VR (working on using cardboardVR with LEAP MOTION controller), 
I mostly work with the MEAN stack, Firebase, WebRTC, OpenCV, iOS & Android.

Current tinkerware- LEAP MOTION controller, STM32F boards & a bunch of ESP8266 modules.

cheers!

Akash
