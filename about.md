Hey there! I'm an ML engineer who also prototypes a lot of electronic products.

I've built UAVs with cellular control & video-streaming using WebRTC, crowdfunded tele-presence solutions & built articulated robots. I'm also working on creating EVs, digital assistants & droids(TARS like) with somewhat AGI(whatever that becomes).


Mulling over inter-planetary travel, dragon-esque planes (look up Kitty Hawk) & cliff-running are things that occupy my mind whenever I go for a run.

Cheers!

Akash
