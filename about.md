  BUILD. IMPACT. REPEAT.
</p>

Hey there! I am Akash Paul, an Electronics & Communication engineering graduate from VVP Rajkot.

I build robots, focussing on UAVs, Tele-presence & Automation. I also prototype structures using my 3D printer, currently playing with the ESP8266 & ARM SBC boards.

I also love working on VR (working on using cardboardVR with LEAP), Machine Learning & Neural Nets, Node.js, opencv, Android SDK & NDK alongwith the Processing IDE.
