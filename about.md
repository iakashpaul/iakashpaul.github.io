Hey there! I am Akash Paul.

{SW:IDEAPLEXUS, HW:BHAMA ROBOTICS, MISC:3DKin}

I work on UAVs, tele-presence solutions & industrial robotics. I've also got a keen interest in building digital assistants, electric vehicles, humanoids with AGI & some other stuff.

I also love working on VR (working on using cardboardVR with LEAP MOTION controller), Node.js, WebRTC, OpenCV & Android.

Current tinkerware- LEAP MOTION controller, STM32F boards & a bunch of ESP8266 modules.
