Hey there! I'm an ML engineer who also prototypes a lot of electronic products.

I've previously built UAVs with cellular control, video-streaming apps using WebRTC, worked on a crowdfunded tele-presence solution & built articulated 5 DoF arms. I'm also working on creating LLM powered digital assistants & droids(like Chappie/TARS) to help around various tasks.

Cheers!
Akash
