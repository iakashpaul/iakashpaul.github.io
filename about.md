Hey there! I'm an ML engineer who also prototypes a lot of electronics(finishing up a Qlock Two clock currently).

I've previously built UAVs with cellular control, video-streaming apps using WebRTC, worked on a crowdfunded tele-presence solution & built articulated 5 DoF arms. I'm also working on creating LLM powered digital assistants & droids(like Chappie/TARS) to help around various tasks.

- Watch more about the things I make on [YouTube/iAkashPaul](https://www.youtube.com/@iAkashPaul) or check out ML work on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/iAkashPaul)

- Got a project or idea in mind to work on? Hit me up on Twitter!

Cheers!
Akash
