Hey there! I'm a freelance software developer who also prototypes a lot of electronic projects.

I've built UAVs with cellular control & video-streaming using WebRTC, tele-presence solutions & industrial robots. I'm also working on creating EVs, digital assistants & droids with AGI. Also focussed on inside-out VR (cardboardVR with Pi+LEAP MOTION).

I care & plan on eventually making RISC-V ICs(larger nm though), PV-cells, Li-Ion batteries(metal-foils) & LED panels in India.

Inter-planetary travel, dragon-esque planes & cliff-diving are things that occupy my mind whenever I go for a run.

Cheers!

Akash
