I've always been intrigued by artificial intelligence & robotics throughout my undergrad & even before that. From reading about this MIT article on [signalling large UAVs via gestures](https://news.mit.edu/2012/robots-hand-gestures-0314) right before starting college & stuff like this RL project to [drift an RC car](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opsmd5yuBF0)

Thought tokens-

## Large language models

* ParaBrain - A planning centric framework for parallelizable/hierarchical Ex. summarization, story-writing, code-gen etc. The prompt to the models would have to bear an identifier for the worker_number/total_workers & then map-reduce w/ callbacks if needed. 

* Stasis - A timeless benchmark & harness for evaluation (& reliability score) of LLMs regardless of their knowledge cut-off dates & availability of certain tools in an environment now that [GPUs in space](https://www.starcloud.com) is an actual thing

## Speech-to-text

* Switcheroo - phonetics over code-mixed audio, could yield better results for OOV words & synthetic words as well 
* Noise robustness like ANC or some other DSP based filter for multiple passes, binaural speaker detection for better diarization, ap-score (dictionary coverage metric for ASR & guiding dataset building efforts) 

## Text-to-speech

* VoiceTrap - Better feature complete implementation of VoiceBox features, some prior attempts(ex3ndr/SuperVoice, LucidRains/VoiceBox) & newer NAR/flow matching archs

## Computer Vision

* QuickTwin - avatar generation w/ Blender

## Robotics

* Droids - Fuse VLMs, ASR, TTS, VAD with attention confirmation, SimpleFOC for a bunch of form factors, tripod, bipedal etc. Start small & then ramp up, optimize for momentum, keeping head/eye-sight stable......
