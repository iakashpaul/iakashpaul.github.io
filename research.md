# Research Interests

I've always been intrigued by artificial intelligence & robotics throughout my undergrad in ECE & even before that. From reading about this MIT article in the paper about [signalling large UAVs via gestures](https://news.mit.edu/2012/robots-hand-gestures-0314) right before starting college & this RL project to [drift an RC car](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opsmd5yuBF0)

## Large language models

* [ParaBrain](https://github.com/iakashpaul/ParaBrain) - A QLoRA attempt to split up token generation across n-copies of the LLM & get faster token-generation for a single prompt/task. Ex. summarization, story-writing, code-gen etc. The prompt to the models would have to bear an identifier for the worker_number/total_workers. 

* [Stasis](https://github.com/iakashpaul/Stasis) - A timeless benchmark & harness for both evaluation & grounding LLMs regardless of their knowledge cut-off dates
